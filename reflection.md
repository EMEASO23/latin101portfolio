A Reflection on the Dark Side of the Subjunctive

As a chemistry major and a student who naturally flourishes in science classes, I initially signed up for Latin 101 hoping for an easy semester checking off the language requirement and ending in A. Fortunately, this semester of Latin has been nothing that I expected. I have not only been pushed to my academic limits, through study of grammatical gender, memorization irregular verb forms, and the composition of complex sentences, but even more challenging, I have been forced to examine my personal life through study of the subjunctive. 

	In Phuc Tran’s TED talk he says, “The subjunctive is like a pandora’s box of hope and regret… it blinded me to what was because I was so fixated on what wasn’t.” When I first heard this I was confused yet intrigued. The idea that language and its nuances can change your perspective on the world so greatly was foreign to me, until I reflected on Phuc Tran’s TED talk. Throughout my entire life study of language, including english, has always just been a requirement for me and nothing more. I have never allowed myself to explore the abstract ideas of language because I have been so focused on grammatical structures and getting good grades. 
	
	When listening to Phuc Tran share his story, I found many parallels to my own life and my own journey with mental illness. As someone who struggles with anxiety, obsession over the subjunctive, the idea of what “could happen” or “should have happened,” is the root cause of many of my “bad” days. Thus, after his visit I forced myself to sit down and reflect upon how a greater control of language might help my own mental health. Since Phuc Tran’s visit, not only in our classes and practicums, but in all settings of my life I have begun embracing language. I have been challenging myself to notice how phrasing a sentence in the indicative versus the subjunctive changes my mood and the moods of those around me. I have learned that subjunctive is important to allow creativity and expression but when left ungrounded by statements in the indicative, any one, even language scholars, can find themself in a pit of regret and hopelessness. 
	
	I think the most important thing I have learned this semester in latin 101 is that language is much more than grammatical structures and memorization of forms and functions. Language is an abstract concept that can greatly shape our perception of the world around us.
