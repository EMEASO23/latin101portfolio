Cum *Achīvī* decem annōs Troiam **capere nōn possent**, *Epeus* equum mirae magnitūdinis ligneum **fēcit**.
In eō **collēctī sunt** *Menelaus, Ulixēs, Diomedes, Thessander, Sthenelus, Acamas, Thoas, Machaon, Neoptolemus.*
et in equō **scripsērunt** “*DANAI* MINERVAE DONUM **DANT**”, castraque **transtulērunt** Tenedo.
Cum id *Troianī* **vidērunt**, **arbitratī sunt** *hostēs* **abisse**; *Priamus* **imperāvit** *equum* in templum Minervae **ducī**.
Cum *vātēs*, Cassandra, **diceret** *equum* **habere** hostes, *fidēs* eī **data non est** et equum pro templō **posuērunt**.
*Achīvī* **exiērunt** portārumque custodēs **occidērunt** et Troiam **sunt potitī**.



During the ten years in which the Greeks could not capture Troy, Epeus made a wooden horse of amazing size.
Menelaus, Ulixes, Diomedes, Thessander, Sthenelus, Acamas, Thoas, Machaon, and Neoptolemus gathered together in it.
And in the horse they wrote, “The Greek give the gift to Minerva”, and carried to Tenedos.
When the people of Troy saw it, and they thought that the enemy went away; Priamus ordered that the horse be led to the temple of Minerva.
And the prophet, Cassandra, told them to hold the horse of the enemy, faith was not given to them and they placed the horse in front of the temple.
The Greeks came out and killed the guards of the gate and conquered Troy.
