Erin Eason
Latin 101-01
Translation 4


Cum *Achīvī* decem annōs Troiam **capere nōn possent**, *Epeus* equum mirae magnitūdinis ligneum **fēcit**.
In eō **collēctī sunt** *Menelaus, Ulixēs, Diomedes, Thessander, Sthenelus, Acamas, Thoas, Machaon, Neoptolemus.*
et in equō **scripsērunt** “*DANAI* MINERVAE DONUM **DANT**”, castraque **transtulērunt** Tenedo.
Cum id *Troianī* **vidērunt**, **arbitratī sunt** *hostēs* **abisse**; *Priamus* **imperāvit** *equum* in templum Minervae **ducī**.
Cum *vātēs*, Cassandra, **diceret** equum **habere** hostes, *fidēs* eī data non **est** et equum pro templō **posuērunt**.
*Achīvī* **exiērunt** portārumque custodēs **occidērunt** et Troiam **sunt potitī**.


**In the indirect statement introduced by "diceret", is there a subject (in accusative) for the infinitive?**
**In the clause "fidēs eī data non est," you've identified half of the verb ... ***

During the ten years in which the Greeks could not capture Troy, Epeus made a wooden horse of amazing size.
Menelaus, Ulixes, Diomedes, Thessander, Sthenelus, Acamas, Thoas, Machaon, and Neoptolemus gathered together in it.
And in the horse they wrote, “The Greek give the gift of Minerva”, and carried to Tenedos.
When the people of Troy saw it, and they thought that the enemy went away; Priamus ordered that the horse be led to the temple of Minerva.
And the prophet, Cassandra, told them to hold the horse of the enemy, faith was not their gift and they placed the horse in front of the temple.
The Greeks came out and killed the guards of the gate and conquered Troy.

1. What case is decem annōs and why?
- Accusative because it is saying throughout a duration of time
2. Parse possent (PNTMV) and explain its mood.
- third-person plural imperfect active subjunctive
- It is subjunctive because it expresses possibility. It is the verb of a temporal clause that is expressing a duration of time **The first part is incorrect:  subjunctive does not by itself imply "possibility."  The second part is on the right track!  We're in a temporal clause: specifically, why did Hyginus choose subjunctive instead of indicative?**
3. Explain the sentence structure of DANAI MINERVAE DONUM DANT?
- This is a Direct quote.  **Can you identify how each word functions (subject, verb...)?**
4. What type of verb is arbitrati sunt?
- Deponent verb → has no active forms
5. What kind of grammatical construction do we have in the sentence Priamus imperavit equum in templum Minervae duci? Identify its constituent parts.
- Indirect statement
- accusative subject = equum
- passive infinitive = duci
6. Parse duci.
- Present passive infinitive
7. What case is ei and what role is it playing in the sentence?
- dative **Yes!  What is its function?**
8. What is the function of the que in portārumque?
- Acts as the word "and" without being repetitive **(Yes: a "conjunction")**
